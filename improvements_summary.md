# Emerald Landing Page Improvements - UI/UX Report

## Overview
Using the **UI/UX Pro Max** skill and our competitive research data, we have upgraded the `ai_studio_code.html` landing page to align with the "Heritage-Narrative" trend seen in top competitors like Graff and Tiffany & Co.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Rebranding & Localization
*   **Brand Identity**: Renamed to **"VETA REAL"** (Royal Vein) to evoke the deep mining heritage of Colombia. Created a custom minimalist logo.
*   **Spanish Localization**: Fully translated the interface to Spanish.

### 2. Experimental Visuals (New)
*   **Aurora Animation**: Incorporated a subtle, moving "Aurora" background effect behind the Hero text.
    *   *Tech Note*: Ported from React/Tailwind to pure CSS to work within the current static environment.
    *   *Aesthetic*: Custom-tuned with Emerald Green and Antique Gold gradients to match the brand palette.

### 3. "Tech-Transparent" Trust Signals
*   **Trust Bar**: Added a dedicated section immediately below the Hero with high-level certifications.
*   **Origin Tags**: Product cards now display the specific mine origin (e.g., "Muzo, COL", "Chivor, COL") directly on the image.

### 4. "Heritage-Narrative" Aesthetics
*   **Refined Palette**: Shifted from a stark white background to "Gallery White" (`#F9F8F4`) for a softer, more luxurious feel.
*   **Typography**: Enforced `Cormorant Garamond` for headings.
*   **Interactive Cards**: Hover effects now reveal a clean white detail pane with "Vista Rápida" buttons.

### 5. Integrated Education ("The Jardin")
*   **New Module**: Inserted a dark-mode content block explaining "Jardín" (inclusions).
*   **Visuals**: Replaced stock imagery with a generated cinematic macro shot of a raw emerald crystal.

## Next Steps
*   **Mobile Testing**: Verify the double-column layout on smaller screens.
*   **Backend Integration**: Connect the "Consultar" buttons to a CRM or email form.
