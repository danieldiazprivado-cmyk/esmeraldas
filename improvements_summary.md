# Emerald Landing Page Improvements - UI/UX Report

## Overview
Using the **UI/UX Pro Max** skill and our competitive research data, we have upgraded the `ai_studio_code.html` landing page to align with the "Heritage-Narrative" trend seen in top competitors like Graff and Tiffany & Co.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Strategic Copywriting Overhaul (New)
*   **Meta Ads Framework**: Rewrote the entire site narrative using a 17-point "Soft Sell" structure optimized for compliance.
*   **Curiosity Headline**: Changed "La Pureza..." to *"El Secreto de las Montañas de Muzo"* to increase CTR.
*   **Problem/Agitation**: Added a section addressing the fear of fake/treated emeralds (*"¿Es realmente una Esmeralda Natural?"*).
*   **Credibility**: Expanded the "Trust Bar" to include specific authority markers (4th Generation Miners).
*   **Offers & Guarantees**: Clarity on bonuses (Luxury Case, Lifetime Cleaning) and a lifetime authenticity guarantee.

### 2. Rebranding & Localization
*   **Brand Identity**: Renamed to **"VETA REAL"** (Royal Vein).
*   **Spanish Localization**: Fully translated the interface to Spanish.

### 3. Experimental Visuals
*   **Aurora Animation**: Incorporated a subtle, moving "Aurora" background effect behind the Hero text (CSS-only port).

### 4. "Tech-Transparent" Trust Signals
*   **Origin Tags**: Product cards display specific mine origin (Muzo, Chivor).
*   **Integrated Education**: Dark-mode section explaining "Jardín" (inclusions) as a proof of authenticity.

## Next Steps
*   **Mobile Testing**: Verify the double-column layout on smaller screens.
*   **Backend Integration**: Connect the "Consultar" buttons to a CRM or email form.
